## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I focused on structuring HTML semantically and improving my CSS skills. I also worked on improving the layout using Flexbox and ensuring a responsive design.

Hereâ€™s a small snippet of my CSS:

```css
main {
    max-width: 720px;
    margin: 12vh auto;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 40px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    font-family: "Outfit", serif;
}
