## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

During this challenge, I focused on structuring HTML semantically and improving my CSS skills. 

Hereâ€™s a small snippet of my CSS:

```css
main {
    max-width: 720px;
    margin: 12vh auto;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 40px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    font-family: "Outfit", serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my CSS layout skills, particularly with CSS Grid and Flexbox. Additionally, I plan to explore adding animations for a better user experience.

### Useful resources

[MDN Web Docs - HTML Semantic Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) - Provided clarity on structuring HTML effectively.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Helped me choose the best font pairing for the project.
